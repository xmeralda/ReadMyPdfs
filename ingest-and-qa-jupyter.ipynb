Gottesman, MD, PhD; Miriam Melis, PhD; Mariann R. Piano, RN, PhD; Tiziana Rubino, PhD; Sarah Y. Song, MD; on behalf of the American Heart Association Stroke Brain Health Science Subcommittee of the Stroke Council; Council on Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology; Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; and Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease ABSTRACT: Marijuana is perceived as a harmless drug, and its recreational use has gained popularity among young individuals. The concentration of active ingredients in recreational formulations has gradually increased over time, and high-potency illicit cannabinomimetics have become available. Thus, the consumption of cannabis in the general population is rising. Data from preclinical models demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors are expressed in high density in areas involved in cognition and behavior, particularly during periods of active neurodevelopment and maturation. In addition, growing evidence highlights the role of endogenous cannabinoid pathways in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neurodevelopment. In animal models, exogenous cannabinoids disrupt these important processes and lead to cognitive and Downloaded behavioral abnormalities. These data correlate with the higher risk of cognitive impairment reported in some observational studies done in humans. It is unclear whether the effect of cannabis on cognition reverts after abstinence. However, this evidence, along with the increased risk of stroke reported in marijuana users, raises concerns about its potential long-term effects on cognitive function. This scientific statement reviews the safety of cannabis use from the perspective of brain from health, describes mechanistically how cannabis may cause cognitive dysfunction, and advocates for a more informed health http://ahajournals.org care worker and consumer about the potential for cannabis to adversely affect the brain.

      "page_content='l Vascular Disease ABSTRACT: Marijuana is perceived as a harmless drug, and its recreational use has gained popularity among young individuals. The concentration of active ingredients in recreational formulations has gradually increased over time, and high-potency illicit cannabinomimetics have become available. Thus, the consumption of cannabis in the general population is rising. Data from preclinical models demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors are expressed in high density in areas involved in cognition and behavior, particularly during periods of active neurodevelopment and maturation. In addition, growing evidence highlights the role of endogenous cannabinoid pathways in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neurodevelopment. In animal models, exogenous cannabinoids disrupt these important processes and lead to cognitive and Downloaded behavioral abnormalities. These data correlate with the higher risk of cognitive impairment reported in some obser' metadata={'page_number': 1, 'chunk': 1, 'source': 'p1-1', 'title': 'Use of Marijuana: Effect on Brain Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association', 'author': '', 'creation_date': \"D:20220321130727+05'30'\"}\n",

These data correlate with the higher risk of cognitive impairment reported in some observational studies done in humans. It is unclear whether the effect of cannabis on cognition reverts after abstinence. However, this evidence, along with the increased risk of stroke reported in marijuana users, raises concerns about its potential long-term effects on cognitive function.

      "answer: According to the provided sources, THC (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is the primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana. The sources mention that the use of THC has gradually increased from approximately 4% in 1995 to 15% in 2018 among the US population aged 12 and above. They also state that cannabinoid receptors, which interact with THC, are expressed in high density in areas of the brain involved in executive function and affect synaptic plasticity. The sources suggest that THC disrupts endocannabinoid signaling pathways and affects the strength of interneuronal connections in the short term, leading to changes in the functioning of neuronal networks in the long term. However, it is important to note that the sources do not provide a comprehensive analysis of THC and its effects, so further research may be necessary for a more complete understanding.\n"
